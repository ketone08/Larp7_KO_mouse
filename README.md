# Larp7_KO_mouse
Mouse models of Alazami syndrome reveal a developmental window of vulnerability in the hippocampal dentate gyrus to transcriptional dysregulation

To identify differentially regulated pathways during neurosphere differentiation, RNA-seq profiling of wild-type and larp7 knockout neurosphere after 2 days differentiation.   ATAC-seq profiling of wild-type and larp7 knockout neurosphere.  CUT&Tag of RNA polymerase II, Pol II-Ser2 and Pol II-Ser5 in wild-type and larp7 knockout neurosphere. Single-cell RNA-seq was used to analyze cell compositions and functional states of the dentate gyrus, obtained from micro-dissected wild-type, Larp7f/f;Emx1-Cre, and Larp7f/f;nestin-Cre mutant mice at P7, respectively.  To obtain enough materials, 3-4 dentate gyri from littermates were combined for each genotype.
